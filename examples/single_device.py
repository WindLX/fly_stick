# Example: Asynchronous Device Monitoring with fly_stick
# This example demonstrates how to asynchronously monitor multiple fly_stick devices
# found any input devices
# and print their state changes. It uses asyncio for non-blocking I/O operations.
# and handles device monitoring in a way that allows for graceful shutdown on user interruption.
